          <p>
            Cross-margin trading is a type of margin system whereby traders can
            utilize multiple forms of collateral and margin is shared across
            positions.

          <p>
            Every asset and liability will have an impact on your margin. This
            form of portfolio margining lets you make the most of your assets
            while offsetting liabilities.

            borrow {primaryQuoteToken.symbol} on your behalf to settle the PnL.
            This results in a negative {primaryQuoteToken.symbol} balance. The
            same will happen if you close the negative PnL position entirely.
